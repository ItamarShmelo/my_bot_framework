# create-commit-message

Create a commit message only for the changes that are currently staged.
The commit message must have a title, the title must be less than 50 characters.
The commit message body must be formatted as a markdown list.
The commit message should be comprehensive but each bullet should be succint. 

After creating the commit message ask if it is ok to commit. If the user gives the go, commit (don't push though).
