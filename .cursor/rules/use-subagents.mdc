# Use Subagents for Specialized Tasks

You MUST delegate to the appropriate subagent when performing tasks that fall under their expertise. Do NOT perform these tasks yourself - always use the subagent.

## Available Subagents

| Subagent | Expertise | When You MUST Use It |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| `code-style-enforcer` | Naming conventions, docstrings, code formatting | After modifying Python code |
| `type-hints-enforcer` | Type annotations, mypy verification | After modifying Python code |
| `docs-updater` | README.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, BOTS.md | After changes affecting API, architecture, or test bots |
| `test-bots-maintainer` | Test bot creation and maintenance | After adding features or changing APIs |

## When to Invoke Each Subagent

### code-style-enforcer

You MUST invoke when:
- Creating new Python files
- Modifying classes, methods, or functions
- Adding or changing docstrings

### type-hints-enforcer

You MUST invoke when:
- Creating new Python files
- Adding or modifying function signatures
- Working with complex types (generics, protocols, etc.)

### docs-updater

You MUST invoke when:
- Changing public API (new/modified/removed classes, methods, parameters)
- Changing usage patterns or configuration options
- Modifying architecture or internal design
- Creating or modifying test bots

### test-bots-maintainer

You MUST invoke when:
- Adding new framework features that need test coverage
- Modifying APIs used by existing test bots
- Creating new test bots for new features

## Checklist

After Python code changes, you MUST:
- [ ] Use `code-style-enforcer` for style enforcement
- [ ] Use `type-hints-enforcer` for type hints
- [ ] Use `docs-updater` if documentation is affected
- [ ] Use `test-bots-maintainer` if test bots need updates
